# About Usbong #
**"Usbong"** in Filipino is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can mean _"a bud, a sprout, a shoot"_. As a verb, it means _"to sprout, to grow, to develop"_. In Bisaya, it means _"to burgeon, to grow, to expand, and to flourish."_

For us (and hopefully for you too), **"Usbong"** also means an **open-source platform** that helps people **create their own Android apps** to solve problems in their own contexts and ultimately make them and the people they care about HAPPIER.

# Applications #
**Usbong** can be applied to several contexts, which means that if used appropriately, can facilitate in creating an impact in the lives of people. The idea is that as long as the target context uses some form of:

  * flowchart
  * clinical pathway
  * step-by-step guide
  * cookbook recipe, or even
  * a branching storybook (ala choose-your-own-adventure)

that can be turned into a **decision tree**, the Usbong platform should enable people to transform that into a mobile application by putting together components (e.g. text inputs, checkboxes, radiobuttons, camera, voice recorders) using a **spreadsheet** or a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

# Uses #
Some of the applications that are using **Usbong** include:

  * Education
  * Environment
  * Healthcare
    * pediatric care (using the Intergrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI))
    * telerehab (as a digital survey form to gather patient history of stroke in the family or signs of stroke prior to the experiment)
    * multilingual medical triage (using telephone triage protocols)
    * positive psychology (as a survey/evaluation tool to measure happiness)

Data captured from the mobile device running Usbong are stored in the SD Card as .CSV, .JPG, and .3GP. Data can also be sent to a web server running on traditional servers or low-cost and low power-consuming devices like the plug computer.

Alternatively, data can be sent to Gmail, G+, Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Dropbox, among
many others.

# Multilingual #
Interestingly, besides English, Usbong can **display East Asian characters**, as well as **speak in English and Filipino (modified Spanish Accent)**.

# Open Source #
At present, we are developing **Usbong** with partners in government, industry, and academe, but we would love to work with _people from different parts of the world too_.
