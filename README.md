"Usbong" helps people build apps. 

Usbong as an open source platform can be applied to several contexts, which means that if used appropriately, it can facilitate in creating an impact in the lives of people. The idea is that as long as the target context uses some form of:

flowchart
clinical pathway
step-by-step guide
cookbook recipe
an interactive branching storybook (ala choose-your-own-adventure)

that can be turned into a decision tree, the Usbong should enable people to transform that into a mobile application by putting together components (e.g. text inputs, checkboxes, radiobuttons, camera, voice recorders) using Usbong Builder (companion open source app) or Google Drive Spreadsheet.

Data captured from the mobile device running Usbong are stored in the SD Card as .CSV, .JPG, and .3GP. Data can also be sent to a web server running on traditional servers or low-cost and low power-consuming devices like the plug computer.

Alternatively, data can be sent to Gmail, G+, Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Dropbox, among many others.
